// arg2.c - WIP (not working)
// test a feature to allow passing of command-line arguments
//  (which would set globals argc and arg1)

// code below should be wrapped in a mainuser(argc,arg1) { [user code] }
//  function by a compiler pass.
// not yet working as our compiler has no reference to these variables and throws
//  an undefined variable error (but if we define argc and arg1 here those will be
//  which are confused with parameters passed by the wrapper)
// TODO: perhaps modify resolve_scope to manually add argc and arg1 as local-scope variables
//       for the created mainuser() function? Or add an optional compiler pass that does that?
//       (also would want to add them as reserved words as well?)

print argc;
if argc > 0 {
    print arg1;
